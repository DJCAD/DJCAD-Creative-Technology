Aims
In this module students will gather new theoretical and practical understanding of what it means to be a creative technologist. Through learning how to tell stories about and with technology, students will gain a deep understanding of how open hardware and software platforms can be used as prototyping tools within socially motivated design projects. This will most likely include open hardware platforms, such as, Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Electric Imp. The module will also be closely aligned to the new Make Space facility at DJCAD.

Intended learning outcomes
Students should be able to:

•	Critically build narratives around current issues and trends relating to social uses of technology, including, for example, Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT) and open hardware platforms.

•	Apply a range of specialised techniques and practices to build a technical prototype that can be used as a tool to gain insights into social experiences. 

•	Develop a critical understanding of how a technical prototype can be designed to a professional standard and made robust enough for testing with people.

•	Demonstrate an ability to build models and other related props to assist the narrative creation about and with technologies, drawing upon specialised research methods such as experience prototyping, user scenarios and storyboarding. 

•	Critically reflect on your ability to combine technical knowledge with product design know-how over a significant area of study.

Indicative content

•	Current issues and trends relating to social uses of technology, such as, Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT). 
•	Open hardware and software platforms (e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Electric Imp).
•	Testing technical prototypes with users.
•	User experience prototyping tools.
•	Scenario-building and planning.
•	Narrative storytelling techniques.
•	Digital fabrication tools and techniques (e.g. 3D printing, CNC milling, laser cutting and scanning etc.).

Material for the above will be drawn from the key texts as identified on section on Library Resources (Module Rationale). 

Modes of delivery and student participation
The module will be delivered through a series of in-studio practical project sessions, supplemented by other teaching methods. In the studio environment staff and students will work together on specific issues and problems, as well as students working independently with staff on hand to offer advice and guidance. Practical studio based activity will be supported by seminars, demonstrations and tutorials to aid in the understanding of the issues being explored.

Focused technology workshops will be used to accelerate student learning of new technology. The focus of these workshops will be on skills alongside confidence building for new students that may have traditional design skills than technology focused (i.e. interactive devices).  

Teaching, learning and assessment
Teaching will be delivered through a series of lectures, practical workshops and tutorials. The contextual lectures will provide an introduction to creative technologies and will allow students to effectively integrate theory to practice. The practical technology workshops will be used to accelerate student learning of new technology, encouraging them to play, experiment and explore with open hardware and software platforms. 

Teaching will be conducted in the design studio, media labs and the DJCAD Make Space, where staff and students will work together on specific issues and problems. Students will be responsible for driving their learning through effective interaction with tutors, peers and others. 

There are no examinations associated with this module. Assessment will be through a highly resolved technical prototype and a piece of reflective writing (e.g. essay, report or booklet). 

Students will also be required to prepare work for presentations both for formal assessments and day-to-day work.

Summative assessment: 
•	Coursework (%) 
•	Examination (%, No. and  duration of exams.)
•	Highly resolved technical prototype (60%)
•	Reflective Writing; 2000-2500 words (40%)

All elements must be passed in order to pass this module.

Assessment Criteria:

1.	Have you demonstrated an ability to critically evaluate and build narratives around current issues and trends relating to social uses of technology?

2.	Have you applied a range of specialised techniques and practices to build a technical prototype that can be used as a tool to gain insights into social experiences?

3.	Have you developed a critical understanding of how a technical prototype can be designed to a professional standard and made robust enough for testing with people?

4.	Can you demonstrate an ability to build models and other related props to assist the narrative creation about and with technologies, drawing upon specialised research methods such as experience prototyping, user scenarios and storyboarding?

5.	Can you critically reflect on your ability to combine technical knowledge with product design know-how over a significant area of study?
